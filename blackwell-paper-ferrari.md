# Cornelius Nepos and Aristides

## Introduction

Cornelius Nepos' "lives of Eminent Commanders" is a work of writing that carefully depicts the lives of great military leaders and kings in Ancient Greece in great detail.  The third chapter about Aristides is one of the longer excerpts in the piece due not only to the vast amount Aristides did in his lifetime, but also the plethora of opinions Nepos had of Aristides.

## Nepos

Nepos' Birth is disputed, but Eusebius places his life within the fourth reign of Augustus and PLiny the Elder stated that he died in the reign of Augustus around 110BC - 25BC (Wikepedia).  This time period is long after the tie of Aristides.  Although he wrote about Greek figures, Nepos himself is a Roman.  Most of Nepos writings are lost but many other authors reference him in their works (Wikepedia).

## Prologue

Aristides was the son of Lysimachus and a native Athenian known for his uprightness and honor.  A very important figure in Aristides’ story, who could be discussed for just as long, is Themistocles.  Themistocles was a politician and general in Athens who was born around the same time as Aristides (Nepos).  Aristides and Themistocles always competed with each other for positions of power and influence.  Plutarch claims that their rivalry began at a young age when they competed for the love of a young boy in his work Parallel Lives.  It would turn out that Themistocles would be in a position over Aristides and Ostracise him due to his last name.  Aristides was the only person known throughout history up until Nepos’ time to be referred to as “The Just.”  

Ostracism was an act under Athen’s democracy that could exile anyone for ten years.  It was usually used for those who were thought to be a threat to democracy or a potential tyrant (Blackwell).  In Aristides case, though, it is a clear example of it being misused in a tyrannical fashion.  

Aristides’ ostracism did not change loyalty for Athens and Themistocles or his knack for leadership.  He fought with the Athenian navy at Salamis.  He also commanded the Athenians at Plataea against the barbarians.  Eventually, he became commander of the common fleet of Greece against the common enemy of the barbarians.  It was through the leadership of Aristides and Pausanias of this fleet that the city states of Greece were able to unite.  All other accounts of him are of the uprightness of his leadership, of his “justice, equity, and self control” (Nepos).  He was trusted so much that he was chosen to collect money for the funding of the fleet of Greece.  This money was later removed to Athens when no longer needed, the city state that betrayed him.  Aristides did not serve the full ten years of his banishment.  After Xerxes had conquered Greece, he was called back to Athens by a decree of the people roughly six years into his sentence (Nepos).  Despite being such an important figure in Athens and Greece as a whole, and despite being in charge of such large funds, he died in poverty barely leaving enough money to pay for his own funeral (Nepos).  

## Conclusion

Aristides could be summed up through Nepos' writing as a man that was wrongfully betrayed by those whom he sought to serve and protect, yet his loyalty remained unchanged and continued to pour his life into the service of Athens and its people through politics, economics, and unparalleled military leadership with morality ahead of his time.
