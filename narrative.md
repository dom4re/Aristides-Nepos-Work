# What I Learned in My FYW By: Domenic Ferrari

## The Development of Information Throughout history

One of the most interesting things Learned in my first year writing seminar was how far technology and how we communicate has changed in less than a century and why certain things are the way that they are.  The layout of a keyboard, for example, came to be the way it is because people were typing too fast for typewriters at the time.  therefore, the current layout was developed to slow down typing speed.  By the time computers came around, consumers were so used to this layout that it stayed. I learned about how inventions came all the way from the Linotype machine to the laptop I am writing on now, giving me a better understanding of how it works and appreciation for the time I live in.  Learning about word processors and markdown files showed me how to put together a paper how I actually wanted after first worrying about the composition.  My new knowledge of markdown files also makes it easier to change my papers into different kinds of files without ruining the format I constructed in it.

## The Feminist Movement

Although I did my project over Cornelius Nepos and not Plutarch, I was amazed to find out about Plutarch's respect for the women abroad and in his life and how verbal he was about it Despite the criticism he knew he would face. He calls out Thucydides for his opinions the names many well known, powerful women at such as Semiramis, Tanaquil, and Timocleia.  Learning about these women shed light on a point of history that I always thought was only filled with men's stories.  Plutarch's words of Flavia Clea, a close friend and spiritual advisor of his, left no doubt in my mind that Plutarch had a real respect for women.  Feminism may have not been a term then, but Plutarch shows just how far back its ideologies go.

## Scala Programming

Scala programming is something else that gave me a deeper understanding of my computer and also of cloud based sharing.  Scala allowed my classmates and I to break down the works of Cornelius Nepos by analyzing each sentence and word and pull data onto my computer shared with me by my professor through git hub, a free cloud based sharing program that is difficult to have a complete understanding of but is something I will be able to use later in my life in the business world.

## Conclusion

I thoroughly enjoyed my time in this first year writing seminar and believe that I learned far more than if I wrote a ten page essay on a fictional book like other seminars that were available.  My class' papers and projects were much shorter than other classes which is more realistic for what we will need in the real world.  Rather than practicing reaching a specific word count, I learned how to make my papers and projects concise and get to the point which is what will be expected of me outside of college since nobody has the time to read a two thousand word report or sit through a thirty minute long presentation.  Far too many first year writing seminars waste the limited time students have to learn useful skills in college.  I feel as though this course was a diamond in the rough amongst other courses.  Although it lacked the general style of other seminars, it truly is one of the best.
